MASAR (MAchine Snapshot, Archiving, and Retrieve) is an EPICS V4 service. The server and client are implemented in C++ and Python. 
The MASAR server takes machine snapshots, archives data in a relational database, and retrieves data from the database. 
The MASAR client provides a GUI that retrieves data, compares data with the live machine, and restores the machine with given snapshot data.

This repository is mainly for PyQt-based MASAR GUI being used at NSLS-II.
